Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Weather App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
1. Project Setup
Create a new directory for your project and add three files:

index.html (HTML file for structure)
styles.css (CSS file for styling)
script.js (JavaScript file for functionality)

2. HTML Structure (index.html)
Create the basic structure of your HTML document. Include an input field for the city name, a button to search for the weather, and a section to display the weather information.

3. CSS Styling (styles.css)
Add basic styling to make your app look nice and user-friendly.

4. JavaScript Functionality (script.js)
Use JavaScript to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it on the page.

Event Listener: Listens for a click on the search button and calls the getWeather function.
Fetching Data: The getWeather function fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name provided by the user.
Displaying Data: If the API returns valid data, the displayWeather function updates the HTML to show the weather information. If the city is not found, it alerts the user.
5. Get API Key
Sign up at OpenWeatherMap to get your API key. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script.js file with your actual API key.

Summary
This guide helps you create a simple weather app by setting up an HTML structure, styling it with CSS, and adding functionality with JavaScript to fetch and display weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
